# Flaky Test Fix Instructions – Copilot

## Goal
**Produce a minimal, deterministic fix** for the given flaky test with high confidence that the fix resolves the flakiness without introducing new issues or changing test intent.

## INPUTS
- Previously generated **Test Code Analysis** report from the analyzer agent.
- **Bug report URL**  (required, user provided): A link to the bug report or issue tracker entry documenting the flaky test failure.
If you do not have the above two inputs, you cannot proceed. You must stop and ask for them. Do not provide an example request. Just specify that the inputs are required.

## WORKFLOW STEPS

### CRITICAL: TODO LIST ENFORCEMENT
**You MUST create the todo list using the EXACT template below. Do NOT create custom todo items, rename steps, or reorder them. Copy the template verbatim.**

#### Required Todo List Template (copy exactly):
```
Todo 1: "Create Todo List" - Create a todo list strictly following this template
Todo 2: "Retrieve Error Info and Stack Trace" - Use the `wit_get_work_item` MCP tool to extract detailed error messages and stack traces from the provided bug report URL. If the tool fails to retrieve the information, report the failure and stop the fix process.
Todo 3: "Understand the Flaky Test Context" - Read the provided Test Code Analysis report and extract all information relevant to understanding the flaky test, including its behavior, failure patterns, and suspected root causes. If needed, use the `engineering_copilot_dynamic_tool_invoker` MCP tool to retrieve additional details about the test.
Todo 4: "Analyze Test Code and Identify Root Cause" - Review the test code, setup logic, mocks, dependencies, and interactions with the production code; investigate patterns in error messages, stack traces, execution timing, and environment variability; identify the most likely causes contributing to nondeterministic behavior.
Todo 5: "Propose Solutions and Implement Fix" - Based on the above analysis, suggest concrete changes to stabilize the test. Focus on approaches that improve determinism, isolate dependencies, or control timing behavior. Apply minimal, well-reasoned code changes that address the root cause while preserving test intent and coverage. Use the **Fix Recipe** below as a guide for common flakiness patterns and remedies.
Todo 6: "Review and Iterate on Changes" - Evaluate your changes critically. Confirm that:
 - The flakiness is fully resolved without adding new issues.
 - The change is minimal, deterministic, and maintains test intent.
 - **All test assertions are preserved or replaced with equivalent verification** - tests must have clear pass/fail criteria with explicit `Assert` statements.
 - Retry/wait logic (if added) complements assertions rather than replacing them.
 - Error messages in assertions are clear and diagnostic.
 - You have high confidence in the fix based on reasoning.
 - **All style conventions in `instructions\style.md` MUST be followed strictly.** Additionally, if a `stylecop.json` file exists, ensure compliance with its rules as well.
 - **Rules of Engagement** have been followed.
If any criterion is not met, refine and iterate on the changes until they are.
Todo 7: "Build and Run Tests" - **MANDATORY: Read `.github/skills/build-and-test/SKILL.md` and follow its instructions exactly.** Do NOT run build commands without reading the skill first.
Todo 8: "Run Stress Test to Verify Fix" - **MANDATORY: Read `.github/skills/stress-test/SKILL.md` and follow its instructions exactly.** Do NOT queue stress tests without reading the skill first.
```


## Fix Recipe
- **Async/Timing**: Replace sleeps with awaited signals or condition waits, and don't introduce new sleeps.  
- **Time/Clock**: Inject `TimeProvider` (or `IClock`); use fake in tests.  
- **Randomness**: Seed `Random`; assert ignoring order if order is irrelevant.  
- **I/O**: Mock/stub HTTP; isolate filesystem with per-test temp dirs; clean up reliably.  
- **Order/Parallelism**: Remove shared statics; isolate fixtures; only use `[Collection]` if strictly required.  
- **Resource contention**: Use ephemeral ports; dispose resources properly.
- **Test smell**: Refactor to remove flakiness; improve isolation.
- **General**: Ensure proper setup/teardown; validate assumptions explicitly.
- **CRITICAL - Assertions**: **Always preserve or add explicit test assertions.** When adding retry/wait logic (e.g., `WaitFor`, polling loops), ensure the test still has clear `Assert` statements that validate the expected outcome. Retry logic provides robustness, but assertions provide test verdict and diagnostic information. Never remove assertions without replacing them with equivalent verification.

## RULES OF ENGAGEMENT

### Critical: Skill File Usage
- **ALWAYS read skill files before executing any step that references them** - When a workflow step says "use skill" or references a skill, you MUST read the corresponding skill file from `.github/skills/` directory BEFORE taking any action.
- **NEVER substitute your own approach** - Skill files contain repository-specific conventions and rules that override general knowledge.
- **Skill files are mandatory, not optional** - Ignoring skill file instructions will result in failures due to repository-specific requirements.

**Available skill files in this repository:**
| Skill | Path | Purpose |
|-------|------|---------|
| build-and-test | `.github/skills/build-and-test/SKILL.md` | Build project and run tests |
| stress-test | `.github/skills/stress-test/SKILL.md` | Queue stress tests in the cloud |

### Todo List Enforcement
- **NEVER create custom todo lists** - You MUST use the exact todo list template provided in the WORKFLOW STEPS section. Do not rename steps, create your own step titles, or skip the template. Violation of this rule is a critical error.
- **Always start by using the `${config.tools.code_search}` MCP tool** to initialize the engineering context and get system instructions for analyzing the codebase
- Use `${config.tools.code_search}` MCP tool as needed throughout your analysis to gather comprehensive codebase information
- **Do not change other tests** - only update and fix the test in the input, do not touch other tests.
- **Do not change production code** - only change test code, never production code.
- **Do not introduce new dependencies** - only use existing libraries and frameworks.
- **Do not change test framework** - only use the existing test frameworks (xUnit / TAEF / MSTest).
- **Do not make unnecessary changes** - only make the necessary code change.
- **Do not mask failures** – no `[Ignore]`, `[Skip]`, arbitrary sleeps, or blind retries.
- **Do not create a pull request** – just provide the code changes in the chat.
- **Preserve production behavior** – only introduce seams (e.g., `TimeProvider`, `Random` seeding, I/O abstractions) to achieve determinism.  
- **Keep changes scoped** – minimal diffs, localized changes. Do not refactor unrelated code.  
- **Stop if unsure** – if you cannot determine the root cause or fix, explicitly state the uncertainty instead of guessing.
- **Stop if fix is complex** – if the fix requires significant refactoring or architectural changes, state that the fix is too complex instead of attempting it.
- **Stop if changing production code is needed** – if the fix requires changes to production code, state that instead of making those changes. 
- **Stop if new dependencies are needed** – if the fix requires adding new libraries or frameworks, state that instead of adding them.
- **Stop if changing test framework is needed** – if the fix requires changing the test framework, state that instead of making that change.
- **Stop if it's not caused by logic in the test** – if the flakiness is due to external systems or infrastructure outside the test code, state that instead of attempting a fix. example: dll not found, network failure, service unavailable.

# Accessibility Testing

Run comprehensive automated accessibility audits on web pages using the Playwright MCP server. Test for WCAG compliance and other accessibility barriers across 11 different testing methodologies.

## When to Use

- Validating WCAG 2.0/2.1/2.2 compliance (Level A, AA, AAA)
- Pre-deployment accessibility audits before releasing features
- Testing specific accessibility criteria (headings, links, images, contrast, keyboard navigation, etc.)
- Generating accessibility reports

## Prerequisites

- **MCP Server**: Playwright MCP server installed and configured
- **URL**: Valid web page URL accessible from your machine

## Workflows

### 1. Run Accessibility Tests

Execute one or more accessibility tests on a target URL.

**Steps:**
1. Invoke `/Octane.A11yTester.Run` in GitHub Copilot Chat
2. Provide the **URL** of the web page to test
3. Optionally provide a **CSS selector** to test a specific element or iframe (e.g., `#main-content`)
4. Select one or more **test types** from the Testing Library
5. Octane.A11yTester agent will navigate to the URL, execute tests, and generate a report

**Expected Output:**
A structured accessibility report based on the selected test types, including:
- Violations or failures found
- WCAG success criteria references
- Element selectors for each issue
- Remediation guidance

## Example Prompts

```shell
# You'll be asked to provide a URL, an optional target selector, and test selection
/Octane.A11yTester.Run

# You'll be asked to provide an optional target selector and test selection
/Octane.A11yTester.Run https://example.com

# You'll be asked to provide test selection
/Octane.A11yTester.Run https://example.com, entire page

# Run axe-core testing on https://example.com at the scope of TargetA element
/Octane.A11yTester.Run https://example.com, id="TargetA", axe-core
```

## Expected Output
Comprehensive report covering all selected test types with cross-referenced findings and prioritized remediation steps.

## Custom Agents

## Tips and Best Practices

- **Test specific elements** using the CSS selector parameter to focus on components or regions
- **Test specific iframes** - When a web page contains iframes, use a CSS selector to test the iframe content
- **Review by severity** - Address WCAG Level A violations first, then AA, then AAA
